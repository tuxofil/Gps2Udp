# Web page with a tracked data on the Google Maps

A JavaScript on the client side downloads a points.txt file
periodically, parses it and shows on the map.

To use the page you need to provide an API key into the page as
described in ["Obtaining an API Key"]
(https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key)
section of the Google Maps Javascript API.

For example, you can do this by following command:

```sed -i "s/{{KEY}}/$YOUR_KEY/" index.html```
